# Security Policy

## 🚨 Critical Security Warning

**EXTREME RISK SOFTWARE**: Cerberus is experimental trading software that handles real cryptocurrency funds. Security vulnerabilities can result in complete loss of funds.

**Use at your own risk. Only use funds you can afford to lose completely.**

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Built-in Security Features

1. **Private Key Encryption**: All private keys are encrypted at rest
2. **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data is zeroized after use
3. **Input Validation**: All external inputs are validated and sanitized
4. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries only
5. **Rate Limiting**: API requests are rate-limited to prevent abuse
6. **Secure Random Generation**: Cryptographically secure randomness
7. **Constant-Time Comparisons**: Prevents timing attacks
8. **Error Sanitization**: No sensitive data in error messages

## 🔐 Security Best Practices for Users

### Wallet Security

1. **Use Burner Wallets**: Never use your main wallet
2. **Limit Funds**: Only deposit what you can afford to lose
3. **Backup Seed Phrases**: Store securely offline
4. **Enable 2FA**: On all related accounts
5. **Regular Audits**: Check wallet activity regularly

### Environment Security

```bash
# Secure file permissions
chmod 600 .env
chmod 600 config/config.toml
chmod 700 data/

# Secure private key storage
export SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat encrypted_key.txt | decrypt)
```

### Network Security

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always use encrypted connections
2. **VPN Recommended**: For additional privacy
3. **Firewall Rules**: Restrict unnecessary ports
4. **Monitor Traffic**: Watch for unusual activity

### Operational Security

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep software updated
2. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for suspicious activity
3. **Backup Data**: Regular encrypted backups
4. **Incident Response**: Have a plan for breaches

## 🛠️ Security Configuration
