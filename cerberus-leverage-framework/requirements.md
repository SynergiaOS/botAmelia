# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Cerberus v4.0 is an ultimate leverage trading framework designed for high-risk, high-reward trading on memecoins with small capital ($50 starting balance). The system aims to scale aggressively to $1000+ using leverage up to 50x while implementing comprehensive risk management, real-time monitoring, and emergency safeguards to prevent catastrophic losses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Trading Engine

**User Story:** As a trader, I want an automated trading system that can execute leverage trades on memecoins, so that I can scale my $50 portfolio aggressively while managing risk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives a trading signal THEN it SHALL evaluate the signal within 100ms
2. WHEN a trading decision is made THEN the system SHALL execute the trade with leverage between 2x and 50x
3. WHEN multiple signals arrive simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them in order of confidence level
4. IF the portfolio balance falls below $10 THEN the system SHALL halt all trading operations
5. WHEN a trade is executed THEN the system SHALL record all trade details in the database

### Requirement 2: Signal Processing and Decision Making

**User Story:** As a trader, I want the system to collect and analyze trading signals from multiple sources, so that I can make informed leverage decisions based on market data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a signal is received THEN the system SHALL validate the signal format and confidence level
2. IF a signal hash already exists in cache THEN the system SHALL return the cached decision within 10ms
3. WHEN signal confidence is "Extreme" THEN the system SHALL consider maximum leverage up to 30x base
4. WHEN signal confidence is "Low" THEN the system SHALL limit base leverage to 5x
5. IF signal data is incomplete or invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the signal and log the error

### Requirement 3: Risk Management System

**User Story:** As a trader, I want comprehensive risk management controls, so that I can prevent catastrophic losses while maximizing profit potential.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN daily losses exceed $15 THEN the system SHALL activate circuit breaker and halt trading
2. WHEN 5 consecutive trades fail THEN the system SHALL trip circuit breaker automatically
3. IF liquidation risk exceeds 2% buffer THEN the system SHALL reduce position size or close positions
4. WHEN portfolio volatility exceeds 15% THEN the system SHALL reduce leverage multiplier to 0.5x
5. IF emergency stop is triggered THEN the system SHALL close all positions within 30 seconds

### Requirement 4: Position Management

**User Story:** As a trader, I want intelligent position management, so that I can maintain optimal exposure while avoiding overextension.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening a position THEN the system SHALL not exceed 3 concurrent positions
2. IF a position moves against the trader by 10% THEN the system SHALL evaluate stop-loss execution
3. WHEN position profit exceeds 20% of portfolio THEN the system SHALL consider partial profit taking
4. IF liquidation price is within 2% of current price THEN the system SHALL close the position immediately
5. WHEN position is opened THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor price movements every 5 seconds

### Requirement 5: Data Storage and Persistence

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data storage with optimized performance, so that the system can handle high-frequency operations without data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL initialize SQLite database with WAL mode enabled
2. IF database operations exceed 100ms THEN the system SHALL log performance warnings
3. WHEN storing signals THEN the system SHALL include timestamp, source, token, and confidence data
4. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection with exponential backoff
5. WHEN system shuts down THEN it SHALL ensure all pending transactions are committed

### Requirement 6: Real-time Monitoring and Alerts

**User Story:** As a trader, I want real-time monitoring and instant alerts, so that I can stay informed about system performance and critical events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system health degrades THEN it SHALL send alerts via Telegram/Discord within 10 seconds
2. IF memory usage exceeds 256MB THEN the system SHALL send resource usage warning
3. WHEN circuit breaker trips THEN it SHALL immediately notify all configured alert channels
4. IF API connections fail THEN the system SHALL alert and attempt reconnection
5. WHEN daily P&L changes significantly THEN it SHALL send performance updates every hour

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Deployment

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible configuration and reliable deployment, so that I can customize system behavior and deploy updates safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from TOML files and environment variables
2. IF configuration validation fails THEN the system SHALL refuse to start and log specific errors
3. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL perform health checks before going live
4. IF emergency reset is needed THEN authorized users SHALL be able to reset circuit breaker
5. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL reload settings without full restart

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a trader, I want high-performance execution with minimal latency, so that I can capitalize on fast-moving memecoin opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing trading signals THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-100ms decision times
2. IF concurrent load increases THEN the system SHALL handle up to 1000 signals per minute
3. WHEN database queries execute THEN they SHALL complete within 50ms for 95% of operations
4. IF system resources are constrained THEN it SHALL prioritize critical trading operations
5. WHEN scaling up THEN the system SHALL maintain performance characteristics under increased load
